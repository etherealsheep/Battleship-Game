# WarMaster Battle Log

![](/images/amiresponsive.jpg)

I love Warmaster (https://www.wm-revolution.com/), best wargame ever created!

For this reason I choose to create a script to keep track of the games of my group of players.

WarMaster Battle Log is a terminal based designed for my WarMaster group, to generate log of every battle, in this way it will be easy to keep track and record progression through the campaign.

WarMaster Battle Log keeps track of the tournament battle scenario played, reporting all relevant game information.

## UX
I wanted to create a battle log generator for fun and to remember the epic moment for every campaign played with my friends.

#### The ideal user:
* WarMaster player

### The log generator will help user to:
* Provide some entertainment.
* Keep track of the played battles.
* Remember the topic moments for every battle.
* Help the Campaign referee to write a story at the end of the campaign.

## Tournament Scenarios
* Four different tournament scenarios are the final logs.
* As WarMaster player I want to have all the tournament scenario first, later on more scenarios will be added.

## The Structure
The script consists of only 1 page which is the terminal page. I am using Python to generate the data and create battle logs.

## The Scope
To achieve my goal, I included the following features in my game:

### Features
* An epic opening banner.
* A list of four scenarios.
* A list of game elements to select in order to provide more scenario details.
* The user can leave the script pressing 5 and another epic banner will be shown.

### Future Features
* Add the complete Army List (23 Armies)
* Add the complete scenario list (more than 16 scenarios).
* Create a script to generate the Winner and Loser result and add it automatically at the end of every log.
* Create a function to export every battle log in a txt file to be saved for future reference.

## The Design
The design is very easy and because it is intended to be used for a very specific type of users (WarMaster players), some effort has been spent to create nice banners.
No graphics other graphics is intended to be used for this project.

## Technologies Used
* [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/workspaces) I used this developer to write the code for this game.
* [Github](https://github.com/) Was used to host my repository and readme.
* [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login) To host my app and deploy here.
